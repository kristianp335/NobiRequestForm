# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is a React-based Liferay Client Extension web component for NOBI (Not Ordinarily Booked Invoices) request form submission. The application is completely client-side and integrates with Liferay's headless admin APIs to fetch company and category data, then submits form data to the NOBI requests collection endpoint. The extension is designed to be deployed locally to a Liferay instance as a custom web component.

## System Architecture

The application is a client-side React Liferay Client Extension with the following key characteristics:

- **Web Component Architecture**: Custom HTML element (`<nobi-form>`) built with React
- **Client-Side Only**: No server dependencies, runs entirely in the browser
- **Liferay API Integration**: Connects to Liferay's headless admin APIs for data
- **Shadow DOM Encapsulation**: Uses Shadow DOM for style isolation
- **Authentication Integration**: Uses Liferay.authToken for secure API calls

## Key Components

### 1. NOBI Form Web Component
- Custom HTML element `<nobi-form>` built with React
- Shadow DOM encapsulation for style isolation
- Responsive design using Liferay global CSS variables
- Form validation and error handling

### 2. Dynamic Data Loading
- Fetches company data from `/o/headless-admin-list-type/v1.0/list-type-definitions/334341`
- Loads NOBI categories from `/o/headless-admin-list-type/v1.0/list-type-definitions/334543`
- Real-time API integration with Liferay authentication

### 3. Form Management
- Comprehensive form with all required NOBI fields
- Company and NOBI category dropdowns (required fields)
- Financial data entry (amounts, currency, cost centers)
- Vendor information management (SAP integration ready)

### 4. Client Extension Structure
- `client-extension.yaml` configuration for Liferay deployment
- Build artifacts: `nobi-form.js` and `nobi-form.css`
- TypeScript/React development stack with Vite bundling

## Data Flow

1. **Invoice Creation**: External systems submit invoice data via POST requests
2. **Data Validation**: System validates required fields and data formats
3. **Category Assignment**: Invoices are categorized using NOBI categories
4. **Company Association**: Invoices are linked to appropriate company entities
5. **Approval Workflow**: Line manager information is captured for approval processes
6. **External System Integration**: Data is synchronized with headless admin services

## External Dependencies

### Headless Admin Service
- **Purpose**: Manages list type definitions and entries
- **Endpoint**: http://localhost:8080/o/headless-admin-list-type/v1.0/
- **Functionality**: Provides CRUD operations for company and category data
- **Authentication**: Supports permissions-based access control

### SAP Integration
- **Purpose**: Vendor management and financial data synchronization
- **Data Points**: Vendor numbers, names, and account details
- **Integration Type**: Likely batch or real-time data exchange

## Deployment Strategy

The current setup suggests a local development environment with:
- Local API services running on port 8080
- RESTful service architecture suitable for containerization
- JSON-based data exchange for easy integration
- Scalable design supporting multiple company entities

**Recommended Production Setup**:
- Containerized deployment using Docker
- Load balancer for high availability
- Database clustering for data persistence
- API gateway for external integrations

## Recent Changes

- June 24, 2025: Made all form fields required with validation
- Auto-fills requestor names from user account API (/o/headless-admin-user/v1.0/my-user-account)
- Auto-generates random 4-digit company number when company is selected
- Updated all primary colors (page indicators, section title borders, progress bar) to use var(--btn-primary-background-color)
